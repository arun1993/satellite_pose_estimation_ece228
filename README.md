# satellite_pose_estimation_ece228

Pose estimation of known uncooperative spacecraft plays an important role in various satellite servicing missions of scientific, economic, and societal benefits. In this work, we aim to estimate the pose, i.e., the relative position and altitude, of a known spacecraft from individual grayscale images using deep neural networks. Convolutional neural networks have been widely exploited for image processing tasks such as object detection, classification, human pose estimation and action recognition.
